##Handwritten Digits Recognition using Machine Learning
#📌 Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using Machine Learning techniques.
The goal is to automatically recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from image data. Such systems are widely used in applications like optical character recognition (OCR), bank cheque processing, postal mail sorting, and form digitization.

The model is trained on digit images and learns patterns to accurately classify unseen handwritten digits.

🎯 #Objectives

To understand image-based classification using machine learning

To preprocess handwritten digit images for model training

To train a model capable of recognizing digits (0–9)

To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy – numerical computations

Pandas – data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning algorithms

Jupyter Notebook – implementation and experimentation

📊 Dataset

The project uses a handwritten digits dataset (e.g., MNIST or similar).

Each image represents a digit from 0 to 9.

Images are preprocessed and flattened before training.

⚙️ Methodology

Data Loading

Load digit images and corresponding labels

Data Preprocessing

Normalize pixel values

Reshape images into feature vectors

Model Training

Train a machine learning classifier on the training data

Model Evaluation

Evaluate performance using accuracy and predictions

Prediction

Test the model on unseen handwritten digit images

📈 Results

The trained model successfully classifies handwritten digits.

Achieves good accuracy on test data.

Demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning for image classification tasks.
