### This section presents sample images and visual outputs from the handwritten digit recognition system.

The images illustrate:

Examples of handwritten digit samples from the dataset

Visualization of digit images after preprocessing

Model predictions on test samples, showing how the system correctly identifies digits from 0 to 9

#### These visual results help in understanding how the model interprets handwritten inputs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the trained classifier in recognizing digit patterns.
